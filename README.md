# Sales-Lead-Prediction: Lead-Scoring
The given project is about X Education which sells online courses to industry professionals. The company markets its courses on several websites and search engines like Google. Now, although X Education gets a lot of leads, its lead conversion rate is very poor. For example,Â if, say, they acquire 100 leads in a day, only about 30 of them are converted.
X Education wants to know what factors will help them to know most promising leads. Thus, I have used Logistic regression that predicts whether a sales lead will be converted or not.
